StereoVision - adaptation for win, python3 and openCV
=============================================================================

StereoVision is a package for working with stereo cameras, especially with the
intent of using them to produce 3D point clouds. The focus is on performance,
ease of usability, and the ability to construct 3D imaging setups cheaply.

StereoVision relies heavily on OpenCV. If you're not sure about what a given
variable does or what values would make sense for it and no explanation is
provided in the StereoVision documentation, refer to OpenCV's documentation in
order to better understand how they work.

This repository is an upgraded fork of the amazing **StereoVision: Library and utilities for 3d reconstruction from stereo cameras** project avaliable `here`_.
